 * I want to implement a streaming connection for a NVIDIA-based gpu. SHIELD integrates the hardware encoder
 * on the card and sends the signal to the Geforce Experience application to launch the desired application.
 * I would like to dig deeper into SHIELD's code to see if I could do it on the Windows platform, which hasn't
 * been released yet under the NVIDIA domain. This would prove beneficial for laptop/surface users who don't
 * want to invest in the Android environment, and it would provide a more comprehensive experience for individuals
 * who have to take their gaming on the go.
